### Impressions/Suggestions:
I really enjoyed this project and I think it really helped me get an introduction to good software design. That said, I think that we would've all benefited from some guidance in learning JavaFX, as I found that there was a steep learning curve. I learned a lot from online Java documentation and online tutorials.
