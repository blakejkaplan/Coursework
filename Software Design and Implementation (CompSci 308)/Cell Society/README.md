# Cell Society
Second Project for CompSci 308 Spring 2016

**Starting the Project:**

To start the simulation, run Main.java, load a file in the GUI, and press start or step through with the step button.

Adjust the appearance to your liking using the config button.

Use the built in file generator to create your own XML file with your preferred abundance percentages of cell states.



**Description**

Cell Society is a cellular automata simulator. Our project is able to run the following cellular automata simulations:

* The Game of Life
* Fire
* Predator Prey
* Segregation
* Foraging Ants
* Sugar Scape

The simulator is also able to adjust parameters such as speed and cell states on the fly to allow for user customization. Additionally, simulations are saved and run from XML files containing grid layouts. The simulator is able to generate new random or weighted grid layouts and save the current grid state of a simulation to XML. Our project also has error checking to ensure that all loaded XML files are valid.
